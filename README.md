Narrate pdf files from the command line

### Description
A simple script to take a pdf and narrate it. Use -i argument to specify input, -o flag to create an .aiff output file, and -h to show help menu.

This was written on and for my OSX computer, using OSX's native 'say' command as a text to speech device. It also uses ghostscript with OSX syntax. All of which is to say it probably *can* work on other OSes, but it might require some tinkering.
